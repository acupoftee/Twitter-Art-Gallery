# For the Love of Art: Twitter art museum visualization

## Problem Statement
The United States cultural economy is threatened as this administration budget proposal is looking to dismantle four independently cultural institutions including the National Endowment of the Arts which has funded numerous art programs. Taxpayers supported museums and other cultural institutions for decades providing easy access to arts and culture education for all. 400,000 Americans and directly contribute $21 billion to the U.S. economy each year and billions more through indirect spending by their visitors. With consentual data mining I propose a visual environment where users can view user tweets about their experiences at various art museums. 

## Intended Users
The visualization framework is intended to be used by art museums to showcase their work digitally. The intended viewers of this visualization would be the general public for educational or recreational purposes. 

## Questions
This data visualization should answer the question of how the internet can be used to make public resources like museums available at a lower cost while engaging with the public, and also whether or not this visualization framework can support the cultural economy. This will also answer the question of finding creative ways to visualize high density data.
